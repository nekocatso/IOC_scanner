Morpheus Setup Script
Author: Phantom0004 (Daryl Gatt)

Description:
This script initializes the Morpheus malware analysis environment by managing 
dependencies, directory structure, and YARA rule configuration. It supports 
multiple installation types, including lightweight and comprehensive editions.

Features:
- Automated directory and dependency setup.
- Repository cloning and YARA rule organization.
- Version tracking for seamless updates.

Usage:
- Run the script to configure the environment and download required YARA rules.
- Ensure sufficient permissions for directory creation and installations.
