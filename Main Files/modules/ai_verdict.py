AI Verdict Processing Module
Author: Phantom0004 (Daryl Gatt)

Description:
Handles AI-driven analysis of YARA scan results, providing structured and detailed insights into potential threats. 
This module interacts with an external AI model to generate contextual intelligence based on detected Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). 

Features:
- **AI-Powered Verdicts:** Sends YARA scan results to an advanced AI model for context-aware threat analysis.
- **Terminal Adaptive Formatting:** Dynamically adjusts output formatting based on terminal capabilities (plain text or Markdown).
- **API Communication Handling:** Manages API requests and response handling, ensuring robust connectivity.

Usage:
- Pass structured YARA scan results to this module.
- The AI model will process the structured IoC findings and return an actionable analysis.
- Depending on terminal support, plain text and Markdown formatting will be selected.

    - Formats AI-generated responses based on terminal support.
    - Manages API requests and error handling for AI communication.

    Attributes:
